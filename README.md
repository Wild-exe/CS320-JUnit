**How can I ensure that my code, program, or software is functional and secure?**
The best solution to ensure functionality and security is to test as exhaustively as possible and use existing resources when possible. Some tests that further this goal include integration, penetration, and input validation tests. Utilizing an external risk assessment for security defects is also beneficial.
**How do I interpret user needs and incorporate them into a program?**
My interpretation of user needs starts with user stories derived from requirement gathering and analysis. These user stories can then be developed and made into test cases to validate and verify that requirements are correctly incorporated.
**How do I approach designing software?**
After Identifying requirements, I like to define the goals of the project. I then will break down the requirements and logic into smaller functions. For instance, if performance is a priority, I will consider Big O when meeting requirements as many problems have different advantages and disadvantages.
